# Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone (Bellabeat Case Study)
By Gabriel Fernandez



## Project in brief
- mention problem
- tools
- insights



## Introduction

Welcome to my Google Analytics Certificate Capstone Project, centered around the Bellabeat case study (Case Study 2: How can a wellness company play it smart?). My objective is to analyze smart device fitness data for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, with a specific focus on the Bellabeat app.  

Through this case study, I will gain valuable insights into how consumers are using the Bellabeat app by performing data analysis. By following the data analysis process steps—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act— I aim to unlock growth opportunities and provide high-level recommendations to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

In this case study, I chose to use **R(RStudio and R Markdown)** for its versatility in completing all phases of data analysis and effectively documenting my findings. This certificate program also introduced me to other valuable tools, including Spreadsheets, SQL, and Tableau.

Visit the [Bellabeat website](https://bellabeat.com/) to learn the company that inspired this case study.

### Business problem

Bellabeat, a successful small company, has the potential to become a major player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, the visionary co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, believes that analyzing smart device data can lead to new growth avenues. As a part of the marketing analytics team, I have been tasked with analyzing smart device usage data for the Bellabeat app to guide marketing strategy based on user behavior insights.

Bellabeat offers smart wellness products and services, including:

- **Bellabeat App**: Tracks activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits, providing insights for a healthier lifestyle.
- Leaf: A versatile wellness tracker worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip, monitoring activity, sleep, and stress.
- Time: A smart wellness watch tracking activity, sleep, and stress, providing daily insights.
- Spring: A water bottle that monitors daily water intake to ensure proper hydration.
- Bellabeat Membership: A subscription-based program offering personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness.


### Data analysis process

I will follow a systematic data analysis process that I learned in the Google Analytics Certificate:

- Ask: Formulating pertinent questions to guide my analysis.
- Prepare: Gathering and organizing relevant data for analysis.
- Process: Cleaning and transforming data for accuracy.
- Analyze: Extracting valuable insights from the data.
- Share: Presenting my findings to the Bellabeat executive team.
- Act: Offering high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### Deliverable 2: Data source description

Data: Introducing the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data

Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk from 30 users in late 2016, offers minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It is accessible on Kaggle.

Access the data: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)
Contributor: Kaggle user [Möbius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic), a Data Scientist specializing in Healthcare.

Bias and credibility concerns: The data collection method through Amazon Mechanical Turk introduces potential biases, including sampling, selection, demographic, and incentive-driven biases. These biases may affect the generalizability of findings.

Data quality checks (ROCCC):

Reliable (Moderate): The data is moderately reliable; while it's user-friendly, concerns about generalizability exist.
Original (No): The data is not original, as it was collected from a third-party source through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Comprehensible (Moderate): The comprehensibility is moderate due to variations in participant numbers, potentially impacting insights.
Current (Outdated): The data is outdated, from 2016, which may affect the relevance of the findings.
Cited (Yes): The data source is properly cited, ensuring transparency and attribution.

Licensing, privacy, security, and  accessibility:

Licensing: The data is under CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication, allowing unrestricted use for commercial purposes.
Privacy: No personally identifiable information is present in the data.
Security: I practiced this step, storing the original data in a password-protected MySQL database.
Accessibility: The data is accessible on Kaggle for ease of access and sharing within the data analysis community.

Data integrity verification: Data integrity was ensured through exploratory data analysis and cleaning processes, including column standardization, data type conversion, duplicate removal, zero-value observation removal, and comprehensive data assessment. See the guiding questions for this phase for more details.

Relevance to analysis:
These datasets provide valuable insights for health and fitness analysis. However, potential biases and data quality concerns should be considered when interpreting the results. Additionally, the lack of gender information may limit its applicability, particularly for products targeted at women by companies like Bellabeat.

Note: During the completion of the capstone, I encountered difficulty in finding an alternative Fitbit dataset, highlighting the challenge of accessing proprietary data. However, during my research, I came across many research articles and analysis that can complement the insights gained from this project. You can find this in the appendix under supplementary analysis
