# Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone (Bellabeat Case Study)
By Gabriel Fernandez

## Introduction

Welcome to my Google Analytics Certificate Capstone Project, centered around the Bellabeat case study (Case Study 2: How can a wellness company play it smart?). My objective is to analyze smart device fitness data for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, with a specific focus on the Bellabeat app.  

Through this case study, I will gain valuable insights into how consumers are using the Bellabeat app by performing data analysis. By following the data analysis process steps—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act— I aim to unlock growth opportunities and provide high-level recommendations to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
